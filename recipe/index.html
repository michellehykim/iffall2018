		<h2>Directions</h2>
			<h3>1</h3>
			<p>Heat the milk until just warm. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and sugar. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and add about 1/3 of the milk. Whisk to combine. Add the flour in 1/3-1/2 at a time, whisking to fully incorporate. When batter is mostly smooth, add the rest of the milk, and mix. Add the melted butter and vanilla, and whisk to combine. Strain the batter through a mesh sieve into another bowl, to remove lumps. Allow to set in fridge for about half an hour.</p>
			<h3>2</h3>
			<p>Whip the cream with the sugar until medium stiff peaks form. Slice the strawberries as thin and evenly as you can, or use a mandolin to slice them. You may want to leave a few strawberries, for garnish, as you may not need the entire pound for the layers (depending on how many layers you make).</p>
			<h3>3</h3>
			<p>Heat a nonstick skillet to medium heat. Pour about 3T of batter and swirl around until you have a thin circle. Wait a minute or two until you are able to flip. When cooked through, remove from pan and place on a plate. Repeat with remaining batter. Have a couple of plates out, so you don't stack the hot crepes right on top of each other. Once they are cooled a bit, you can layer them.</p>
			<h3>4</h3>
			<p>To assemble: On the first crepe, spread a thin layer of whipped cream and a layer of strawberries. Place another crepe on top and repeat until you get to the final layer. Before setting the final crepe on top, cover the last strawberries with another thin layer of whipped cream. This is to keep the strawberries from showing through the top layer. Garnish cake with whipped cream and strawberries, if desired.</p>
