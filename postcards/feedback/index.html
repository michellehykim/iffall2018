<h1>Postcard Feedback to Emma</h1>
<h2>Overall thoughts</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I like your type treatment with bold quote and separation from attributer with light small caps
	<li>Nice that you have solid background - offers contrast with type and easy read</li>
	<li>Styles of images (media and color) different among the three, but I think itâ€™s fine with common concept and type</li>
	<li>A little more horizontal for desktop image</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Feels quite square in dimension and white space makes the two experiences different</li>
			<li>Can add the same purple in photoshop in 1st image, orange to 3rd</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Images feel a bit pixelated/low res</li>
	<li>Font is small on mobile, fine for desktop on all images</li>
</ul>

<h2>1st (taco)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Cut out left corner w the second hand</li>
	<li>Maybe can copy and paste some of the other food elements on the side while elongating it horizontally</li>
</ul>

<h2>2nd (donut)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Maybe move image to center in desktop version, have the full image showing</li>
	<li>Cropping makes sense in vertical mobile format but more satisfying showing the entire thing in desktop</li>
	<li>Think it would fit more with the other images as a set if added background color but not crucial</li>
</ul>

<h2>3rd (spaghetti)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Line length on mobile feels good - I like that you adjusted it from desktop version</li>
	<li>Font is too small on mobile, though, so it might end up changing with scale shift</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The white on the orange background for spaghetti one is really nice because it goes with the white noodles</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The black on the donut is already looking like dark brown in the image</li>
			<li>Maybe make the text on the taco one red/orange, pulling from another color in the image</li>
		</ul>
	<li>I feel like maybe the last two images and quotes can be switched</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Not sure about the donut one, actually, but the digital feel and the white noodles makes sense with the quote about technology and downloading food</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Hang quotation marks (optical alignment)</li>
</ul>
